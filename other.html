            <p>At Heart I am a lighting designer, From small intimate gigs, to corperate stages to empty warehouses
            I find I have a passion for creating the perfect lighting design to fit the unique challenges that each ventue or event brings.
            I have experience in a wide range of lighting consoles and software, including Chamsys, Avolites, Zero88 alongside MA2 and MA3.
            I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in the lighting industry, and I am excited to take on new challenges and projects
            that will continue to push my creative boundaries.</p>

            <p>Even though I am a lighting designer at heart, I also am an experienced Programmer.
                As previously mentioned I have experience in a wide range of lighting consoles and softwares and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in the lighting industry.
                I enjoy the challenge of creating complex lighting cues and effects that enhance the overall performance and create a memorable experience for the audience. 
                However i also know when less is more and that sometimes the simplest of effects can have the biggest impact.
                Majority of my programming experience has been in the live music industry and most commonly, Busking, 
                but I am always looking to expand my skills into other techniques such as Timecode or Reactive lighting.
