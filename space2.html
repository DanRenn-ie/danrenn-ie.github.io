                <p>This was episode six of the Space 2 TV show for Notts TV that Confetti students had recorded, Billy Logan and I were put in charge of the lighting for this event using the Grand MA2 Full size on the main stage. 
                    We worked alongside the Film and TV students at college who were operating the cameras and the music students on stage performing. We were also the designated leads for lighting Design, working with our team to make sure 
                    that both stages and the interview sofa were lit using what we had but also making sure that it looked good on camera. i took lead for designing the stage layouts as Billy worked on preparing the showfile.</p>

            <div class="about-image-container" style="position: relative; width: 400px; max-width: 100%; margin-top: 24px;">
                <img src="ma-portrait.jpg" alt="About-Section-Image" class="about-image-hover" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px;">
                <div class="overlay">Working on this event was a great way to improve my skills with MA2 and working in a different type of environment where both director input and live busking is needed</div>
            </div>

        <div class="Skills-Box" style="text-align: left; max-width: 400px;">
               <img src="space2-back.jpg" alt="About-Section-Image" class="about-image-hover" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px;">
            <p>The recording day was very tightly scheduled causing us to program as a duo for most the day using all 4 screens on the console, this was a great teamwork exercise and 
                let me bounce ideas off of Billy and the director to create a great showfile that we could busk on for the recording. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the main stage we made use of the in house rig consisting of Robe Lighting Pointe's, 
                Clay Paky Axcor Spot 300's, Martin Professional MAC Aura's, Atomic 3000's and ETC Source Fours.
                For the second stage we used a much smaller Rig of small Fresnel Dimmers along with Chauvet Rogue R2X Wash and Prolights Pixroll M fixtures.

            <p>
                I also had the opportunity to work with a team of students from both my own and different courses, which helped me to develop my teamwork and communication skills especially working with a director 
                which was a new experience for all of us. 
            </p>
            <p>Overall, this event was a great learning experience for me and I look forward to working on more events like this in the future.</p>
