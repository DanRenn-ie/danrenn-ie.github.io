                <p>As a Lighting designer I have extensive experience using many different forms of design tool. I always start any rig I make with a 
                    simple sketch of the layout with a pen and paper before moving onto a more detailed design using software such as WYSIWYG, Vectorworks or Capture.
                    I find that this helps me to visualize the design and make any necessary adjustments before moving onto the programming stage.

                <div class="overlay">I am also experienced in rigging and scaffold design, building structures to be stable and completely change the shape of a 
                    room. This has been a great way for me to alter and adapt designs to fit all manner of events, from DJ booths to esports projection screens.

               <p>I have also worked on a multitude of different events, starting my career in theater and then moving to live events i have
                worked in lighting design for a wide range of venues and event types, my favourite being the live music industry but I have also 
                worked on corporate event, festival, and TV show design ensuring that the lighting is fit for both camera and audience.
                I find that this presents its own unique challenges and I enjoy the process of finding creative solutions for each event.

            <p>In addition to my lighting design skills, I also have experience in designing using less conventional methods such as projection mapping and makeshift laser design.
                I find that these techniques can add a unique and dynamic element to a performance, and I enjoy the challenge of creating designs that push the boundaries of traditional lighting conventions.
                I only have a small amount of experience in this field using both, resolume arena and wire, but I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in this area.
