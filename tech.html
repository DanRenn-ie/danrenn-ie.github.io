                    Within the events industry, one of the most important roles is that of a General Tech. From load-in to de-rig, the general techs keep the event running.
                    I have experience in all aspects of event setup and breakdown, including rigging, cable running and testing, and equipment setup and operation.
                    One of my key strengths and most enjoyable aspects of this role is packing cases. From wagons to vans to trailers, I can pack and load equipment efficiently and safely, ensuring that everything is secure and ready for transport.

            <p>As an events technician, I have a wide range of skills and experience in the technical aspects of live events. From pre-rigging to de-rigging, I am able to handle all aspects of the technical setup and breakdown of events.
                I have experience with load-ins, load-outs, and everything in between, including setting up and testing equipment, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly on the day of the event.
                I am also familiar with various types of equipment, including lighting, sound, and video systems, and can provide assistance with setup, operation, and troubleshooting.

            <p>
                I am always looking to expand my skill set and knowledge in the events industry, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and technologies from
                other technicians and professionals in the industry. I love the challenge of working in a fast-paced environment with great people, and I am always looking for new opportunities and connections to help me grow and develop as a technician.
